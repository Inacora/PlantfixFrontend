              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🧼 Clean Your Plants Regularly</h2>
              <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-2">
                "Putting your houseplants in the sink or shower—or if they’re too large, wiping down the leaves with a soft, wet cloth—is one of the best things you can do to keep them happy and thriving," says Justin Hancock.

              <p>Dislodging pests and removing dust improves light absorption. Wrap pots in plastic to avoid soil mess while cleaning.</p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🚿 Improve Drainage—Without Fillers</h2>
              <p class="mb-2">"Both the pot and potting soil should allow water to drain away from the plant's roots," says Jessica Mercer of Plant Addicts.</p>
              <p>Avoid rocks or bark as fillers. They reduce root space and trap moisture. Use only soil for healthier roots.</p>

            <div class="bg-green-100 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🔍 Monitor the Roots</h2>
              <p>Check roots yearly. If more than 75% of the visible mass is roots, it's time to repot. This promotes healthier growth.</p>
            </div>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🪴 Combine New Soil With Old</h2>
              <p>Mix new potting mix with the existing one to maintain drainage and avoid shocking your plant.</p>
            </div>
      
            <div class="bg-green-100 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">💧 Water Dry Soil With Care</h2>
              <p>Gradually add water to dry soil or soak the rootball for 20 minutes to restore hydration evenly.</p>
            </div>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🪟 Try Watering From the Bottom</h2>
              <p>Bottom watering encourages deep roots. Let the plant absorb water from a tray for about 15 minutes.</p>
            </div>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🌞 Understand Your Light Exposure</h2>
              <p>Direct light casts sharp shadows; indirect light is filtered. Adjust plant positions based on their needs.</p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">📏 Calculate How Much Light Your Plants Get</h2>
              <p>Use a light meter app or shadow test. Strong shadows = high light. No shadow = low light. Match plants accordingly.</p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🐛 Prevent Pests</h2>
              <p>Dry out soil, use sticky traps, or Mosquito Bits to fight fungus gnats. Avoid overwatering.</p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">🌱 Use Time-Release Fertilizer</h2>
              <p>Time-release fertilizer provides steady nutrients without burning roots—ideal for consistent growth.</p>
